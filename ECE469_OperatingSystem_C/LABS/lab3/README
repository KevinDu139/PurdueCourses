The sequence of last C and makeprocs is not identical. See piazza discuss.

Check out.txt

To show run queue and wait queue, uncomment line 406 in os/process.c

in Q5

Test auto wake up and its decay value
spawn_me A will sleep for 10 sec after the 5th print

Test yield
spawn_me B will yield everytime it prints

Test auto wake up when there is no other running processes.
spawn_me C will sleep for 10 sec after printing the last element

/os
	make

/app/prio_text
	make
	make run > out.txt

we are using the equation below for sleeping decay.

if (sleeptime >= 100 jiffies) {
  int num_windows_asleep = sleeptime / (TIME_PER_CPU_WINDOW(10) * CPU_WINDOWS_BETWEEN_DECAYS(10));
  estcpu = estcpu * [ (2*load)/(2*load+1) ] ^ (num_windows_asleep);
}
